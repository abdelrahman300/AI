"Birds inspired us to floy ,burdouck inspired velco , and nature has inspired  countless  more inventions .It  seems only logical then, to look at the brains's architecture for inspiration on how to build an inteligent machine . <u>This is the logic that sparked artificial neural networks (ANNs):an ANN is a Machine Learning model inspired by the networks of biological neurons found in our brain <br>
# Biological Neuron 
A human brain has billions of neurons. Neurons are interconnected nerve cells in the human brain that are involved in processing and transmitting chemical and electrical signals. Dendrites are branches that receive information from other neurons.

  Thus, individual biological neurons seem to behave in rather simple way but they are oranized in a vast network of billions with each neuron typically connected to thousands of other  neurons ,much like a complex computational anthill can emerge from the network of fairly simple neurons ants.
  # Rise of Artificial Neurons (Based on Biological Neuron)
  McCulloch and pitts proposed a very simple model of the biological neuron:it has one or  more binary(on/off)inputs and one binary output  ,which later became known aas artificial neuron activates its output when more than certain number of its inputs are active . 
  # What is Artificial Neuron
  An artificial neuron is a mathematical function based on a model of biological neurons, where each neuron takes inputs, weighs them separately, sums them up and passes this sum through a nonlinear function to produce output.
