"Birds inspired us to floy ,burdouck inspired velco , and nature has inspired  countless  more inventions .It  seems only logical then, to look at the brains's architecture for inspiration on how to build an inteligent machine . <u>This is the logic that sparked artificial neural networks (ANNs):an ANN is a Machine Learning model inspired by the networks of biological neurons found in our brain <br>
