# What is Machine LEarning ?
Machine leanring is the sciecne of programming computers so they can learn from data Or Machine learning is  the firld of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicity programmed 
# Why use Machine learning ?
 Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and business operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new products. Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations. Machine learning has become a significant competitive differentiator for many companies.
# Machine Learning is grat for :
 <p>Problems for which exicting solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long list of rules :one ML algorithm can often simplify code and perform better than the traditional approach</p>
 <p>Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yielda no good solution :the beat ML techniques can perhaps find a solution </p>
 <p>Getting insights about complex problems and large amount of data</p>
# Machine Learning applications :

 <p>Supervised : the traing set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions called label </p>
