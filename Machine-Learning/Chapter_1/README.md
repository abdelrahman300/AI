# What is Machine LEarning ?
Machine leanring is the sciecne of programming computers so they can learn from data Or Machine learning is  the firld of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicity programmed 
# Why use Machine learning ?
 Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and business operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new products. Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations. Machine learning has become a significant competitive differentiator for many companies.
# Machine Learning is great for :
 <p>Problems for which exicting solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long list of rules :one ML algorithm can often simplify code and perform better than the traditional approach</p>
 <p>Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yielda no good solution :the beat ML techniques can perhaps find a solution </p>
 <p>Getting insights about complex problems and large amount of data</p>

<h1> Batch learning vs Online learning :</h1>
<P>Batch learning, also known as offline learning, involves training a model on a fixed dataset, or a batch of data, all at once. The model is trained on the entire dataset, and then used to make predictions on new data. This means that batch learning requires a complete dataset before training can begin, and the model cannot be updated once it has been trained without retraining the entire model. Batch learning is commonly used in situations where the dataset is relatively small and can be processed quickly.<p>
<p>On the other hand, online learning, also known as incremental learning or streaming learning, involves training a model on new data as it arrives, one observation at a time. The model is updated each time a new observation is received, allowing it to adapt to changes in the data over time. Online learning is commonly used in situations where the data is too large to be processed all at once, or where the data is constantly changing, such as in stock market data or social media data.</p>
