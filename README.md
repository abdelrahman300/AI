“Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we’ll augment our intelligence.”
![28 Best Quotes About Artificial Intelligence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62572088/235643315-f3027c93-61af-4dd8-b669-15379d924c8c.jpeg)


Artificial Intelligence became one of the most prevalent topics in 2023. AI is here to stay thanks to its practical applications in many industries and in our daily life. That’s why you should prepare better for our technological future by reading top Artificial Intelligence books so in this <u>repo </u>I will try to summary one of the best books for  beginners <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/">Handa-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn,Keras& TensorFlow</a>  based on  My educational journey for AI and I will try make it very simple to understand <br>
